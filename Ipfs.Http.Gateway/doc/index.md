# IPFS HTTP Gateway

Allows HTTP access to IPFS files and directories.  An IPFS Gateway acts as 
a bridge between traditional web browsers and IPFS. Through the gateway, 
users can browse files and websites stored in IPFS as if they were stored 
in a traditional web server.


The interplanetary file system is the permanent web. It is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identities. IPFS enables the creation of completely distributed applications. It aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open.
